# Futhask
Futhask is a code generator that aims to create safe, Haskell friendly wrappers for Futhark libraries.

## Installation
    stack install

## Use
### Generate Code
    futhask [Backend] [Futhark.h] [HaskellSourceDir] [ModuleName]

#### Example
    futhark opencl --library myprogram.fut
    futhask opencl myprogram.h src MyLibrary

For a simple example of how generated haskell code can be used, see [FuthaskExample](https://gitlab.com/Gusten_Isfeldt/futhaskexample)

### Import Code
    import [ModuleName]
    import [ModuleName].Entries

If using `stack` add `c-sources: [Futhark.c]` to the `library` section of `package.yaml`

#### OpenCL
    extra-libraries: OpenCL

#### CUDA
    include-dirs: /opt/cuda/include
    extra-lib-dirs: /opt/cuda/lib
    extra-libraries: cuda cudart nvrtc

#### Metal 
Metal requires .cc for it's entries file, it doesn't seem to need a extra libraries entry in stack.yaml but 
you will need to be on a machine where [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) is available

### Dependencies
`transformers` and `massiv` are required for all backends.
The codes generated for OpenCL and CUDA, both refer to types from the `OpenCL` and `cuda` packages respectively. This is only relevant if one wants to use certain functions in the raw interface, but, without modification, the generated code will not compile without these dependencies.

## Generated Code
The generated code can be split in two main parts, raw and wrapped. The raw interface is simply the C-functions wrapped in the `IO`-monad, providing no added safety and requiring manual memory management. The wrapped interface uses `newForeignPtr` to introduce all Futhark pointers to the GC, and provides function types closer to those used within Futhark, returning tuples instead of writing to pointers.

### Context Generation
    getContext :: [ContextOption] -> IO Context

Available context options will depend on backend used.

### The Fut monad
To make the wrappers safe, and reduce clutter from explicitly passing around the context, the `Fut` monad is introduced. The `Fut` monad is an environment monad that implicitly passes the context around as necessary. Like the `ST` monad, the `Fut` monad is parameterised by a rigid type variable to prevent references to the context from escaping the monad.

To run computations, the function

    runFutIn :: Context -> (forall c. Fut c a) -> a

is used. Additionally

    runFutWith :: [ContextOption] -> (forall c. Fut c a) -> a
    runFut :: (forall c. Fut c a) -> a

are defined for convienience for cases where the context doesn't need to be reused.

### The FutT transformer
For more flexibility, the FutT monad transformer can be used. For convenience the type synonyms

    type Fut = FutT Identity
    type FutIO = FutT IO

are defined, but entry-points are in the general `Monad m => FutT m`.

To run the transformer

    runFutTIn :: Context -> FutT m a -> m a
    runFutTWith :: [ContextOption] -> FutT  m a -> m a
    runFutT :: FutT m a -> m a

For lifting

    mapFutT :: (m a -> n b) -> FutT m a -> FutT n b
    map2FutT :: (m a -> n b -> k c) -> FutT m a -> FutT n b -> FutT k c
    pureFut :: Monad m => Fut a -> FutT m a
    unsafeFromFutIO :: FutIO a -> Fut a

### Input and Output
For conversion between Futhark values and Haskell values, two classes are defined.

    class Input fo ho where
        toFuthark :: Monad m => ho -> FutT m fo

    class Output fo ho where
        fromFuthark :: Monad m => fo -> FutT m ho

Instances of Input and Output are generated for all transparent Futhark-arrays. The Haskell representation is `Array S` from `Data.Massiv.Array`. The absence of functional dependencies in the definitions might require more explicit type signatures, but gives more flexibility to define new instances. For tuples of instances, functions on the form `fromFutharkTN`, where `N` is the tuple size, are defined.

### Memory management
All of the wrapped values have finalizers, and should *eventually* be garbage collected. However, GHCs GC does not know how much memory the context is using, and so collection will not always be triggered frequently enough. This is primarily an issue when the program iterates on Futhark values, without any Haskell-side allocations.

One way to deal with this is to manually manage the memory using

    finalizeFO :: (MonadIO m, FutharkObject wrapped raw) => wrapped -> FutT m ()

As with any manual memory management, the programmer is responsible for ensuring that the finalized value will not be used afterwards. For cases where the object is used in more than one thread without synchronisation,

    addReferenceFO :: (MonadIO m, FutharkObject wrapped raw) => wrapped -> FutT m ()

can be used. `addReferenceFO` increments the reference counter of the object and `finalizeFO` will just decrement this counter until it's `0`.
